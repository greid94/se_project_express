# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is my first project dealing with express as well as implementing a REST api structure. I also am gaining an understanding of how databases work and how information is stored and retreieved on the server side of things. This has been the most interesting project I Have done so far as I see the inner workings of how things operate on the back end.
